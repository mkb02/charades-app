# charades-app

Welcome to my Charades Web App! This application was developed primarily using Python and HTML/CSS. It can be accessed via http://mk1.pythonanywhere.com/ and can be used by anyone. To use this app, simply following the instructions given for each button. Enjoy!

Here are some potential next steps I plan on taking regarding this web app:
  - potentially put all prompts into an online database
  - potentially filter out for anything inappropriate
  - potentially import a list of prompts + add that way
  - potentially make a separate instance for each time the app is used (save only to current browser)
  - export prompt list as csv, pdf, text file
  
Here are the tutorials I referenced:
  - "turning python script into a website": https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/169/
  - "how to make a pop up modal in flask (python)": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nrVtrIBRh8

Here are the bootstrap resources I used:

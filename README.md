# charades-app

Welcome to my Charades Web App! This application was developed primarily using Python and HTML/CSS. It can be accessed via http://mk1.pythonanywhere.com/ and can be used by anyone. To use this app, simply following the instructions given for each button. Enjoy!

Here are some potential next steps I plan on taking regarding this web app:
  - view prompts as a scrollable list 
  - put all prompts into an online database
  - filter out for anything inappropriate
  - import a list of prompts + add that way
  - make a separate instance for each time the app is used (save only to current browser)
  - export prompt list as csv, pdf, text file
  
Here are the tutorials I referenced:
  - "turning python script into a website": https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/169/
  - "how to make a pop up modal in flask (python)": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nrVtrIBRh8

Here are the bootstrap resources I used:
  - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/
  - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/

What I learned:
  - Gained a deeper understanding of Python and HTML, and how they can work together to create a webapp
  - How to debug via standard debug techniques, in addition to using the error log
